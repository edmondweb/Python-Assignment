Weekly Python Assignments
=========================

Welcome to my repository for the weekly Python assignments. Each week focuses on different aspects of Python programming, from basic operations to more advanced concepts like classes, file handling, and error management.

Week 1: Basic Calculator Program
--------------------------------

**Objective:**

* Practice creating Python programs to perform arithmetic and string operations, experimenting with variables, and exploring data types.

**Instructions:**

* Create a Python program that prompts the user to input two numbers and a mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).

* Perform the operation based on the user's input and display the result.

**Example:**

* User inputs: 10, 5, and `+`

* Output: `10 + 5 = 15`

Week 2: List Manipulation
-------------------------

**Objective:**

* Learn and practice working with lists in Python.

**Instructions:**

1. Create an empty list called `my_list`.

2. Append the following elements: `10`, `20`, `30`, `40`.

3. Insert the value `15` at the second position in the list.

4. Extend `my_list` with another list: `[50, 60, 70]`.

5. Remove the last element from `my_list`.

6. Sort `my_list` in ascending order.

7. Find and print the index of the value `30` in `my_list`.

Week 3: Calculate Discount
--------------------------

**Objective:**

* Develop a Python function to perform discount calculations based on the price and discount percentage.

**Instructions:**

* Create a function named `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` that calculates the final price after applying a discount. The function should:
  
  * Apply the discount if the discount percentage is 20% or higher.
  
  * Return the original price if the discount is less than 20%.

* Prompt the user to enter the original price and discount percentage, and display the final price or the original price.



Week 4: File Handling & Error Management
----------------------------------------

**Objective:**

* Learn how to read from and write to files in Python, as well as how to handle errors.

**Instructions:**

1. Create a program that reads a file and writes a modified version to a new file.

2. Handle errors if the file doesn't exist or cannot be read by the user.

**Outcomes:**

* Master file handling and error management in Python, enabling you to write robust and error-free applications.

Week 5: Object-Oriented Programming
-----------------------------------

**Objective:**

* Get hands-on experience with creating Python classes and using inheritance and polymorphism.

**Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class!**

* Create a class representing an object of your choice (e.g., a Smartphone, Book, or Superhero).

* Add attributes and methods to your class.

* Use constructors to initialize each object with unique values.

* Implement inheritance or encapsulation.

**Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge!**

* Create a program that includes different classes (e.g., animals or vehicles) that all have the same method (`move()`), but each class implements `move()` differently.

* For example:
  
  * `Car.move()` prints "Driving üöó"
  
  * `Plane.move()` prints "Flying ‚úàÔ∏è"
